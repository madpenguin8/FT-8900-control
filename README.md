# FT-8900-control
Arduino code to control a Yaesu FT-8900. This code allows headless operation of the 8900 by replicating the data stream that the main unit expects to see. This code should also work with the FT-8800 but I have not tested it yet as I don't own one.

See the comments in the code for deatils on the data structure and communication details.
